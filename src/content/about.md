# Make designs happen

I'm a design engineer specializing in design systems, passionate about fintech and dev tools. I help engineers and designers move faster together.

## What got me here?

I designed my first UI in grade 8. I immediately knew this would be what I want to do for the rest of my life. I also loved programming but I hadn't found a way to combine the two.

Until I read about [Prototyping a Smoother Map](https://medium.com/google-design/google-maps-cb0326d165f5) by a Google's UX engineer - I was fascinated by the idea of being at the intersection of design and engineering.

## What is design engineering to me?


> To me, it is about making designs happen and delivering experiences in their best form.

First, it's sad to see great designs being left on the shelf due to technical uncertainty or lack of buy-ins. And it eventually drains designers.

Second, it's sad to see designs not implemented well, making good products turning slop.

Third, it's sometimes better and faster to design in code. I jump between code and figma very often based on the needs. I code to get prototypes for people to try and ship things. I Figma to explore open-ended problems, and when creativity is needed.

After all, I am still a designer. Engineering is my tool to design. Just like chefs picks the right knives based on the ingredients. I write more in [my blog here](https://blog.rickyzhang.me/).

## Good software should be beautiful

It is the natural outcome of solving problems and taking care.

Details and crafts are a glimpse into the creator's passion and dedication. It is a reflection of the creator's commitment to excellence and a desire to create something meaningful.

The chase of craft proves the love and sacrifice went into our beliefs - for the benefit of user's experience. Look and feel is the quickest to way to tell the quality of the software and make users trust it.

## My values

- **Ship things**: I sometimes make fancy announcement graphics just as a ritual
- **Care about work**: life is short, I make the most of it by creating what we will be proud of
